# What is this?

I want to build a stacks-project-builder
to combine together what one learns, so that one quickly access them,
and maybe view them in the form of dependency graphs,
which are quite cool and awesome.

And this should have a vim-plugin support which utilizes the quickfix
feature of vim, so that jumping between tags is easy and natural.
